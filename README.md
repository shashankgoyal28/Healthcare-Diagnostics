INTRODUCTION 

Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that affects an estimated 463 million people worldwide.[3] It is a metabolic disease affecting a multitude of people worldwide. Its incidence rates are increasing alarmingly every year. If untreated, diabetes-related complications in many vital organs of the body may turn fatal. Early detection of diabetes is very important for timely treatment which can stop the disease progressing to such complications. [1] The goal of this research is to improve early detection efforts by creating a prediction model that will help medical professionals diagnose diabetes. I hope to assist healthcare providers in starting preventative therapies that can enhance the lives of those who are impacted by the disease by offering a tool for precise and effective diagnosis.

I carried out thorough data preparation to guarantee the accuracy and dependability of our dataset to accomplish this aim. I used a neural network model to examine patterns and correlations in the clean, well-prepared data. After training, this neural network was able to reliably predict the existence of diabetes. By using this method, I want to advance the diagnosis of diabetes and perhaps improve public health by providing a useful tool.

OBJECTIVES 

-> Enhance early detection: Support healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals earlier, allowing for timely intervention and treatment.
-> Contribute to healthcare innovation: Offer a novel tool to assist healthcare systems in managing diabetes more effectively through data-driven insights and advanced predictive techniques.
-> Validate on Real-World Data: Test the model on real-world clinical data to assess how it performs outside of controlled experimental datasets.
